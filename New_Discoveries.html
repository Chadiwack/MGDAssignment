	<p>Specimen h289, pictured here, is a type 5 lovecraftian entity. Known to Native inhabitants of the area as "Kabula", this entity is seldom sited, preffering to remain in slumber beneath large mounds for upwards of 250 years. The last known sighting of this creature occured just after the revolutionary war. Though normally docile, this most recent awakening seems to differ in nature from previously viewed sightings. Normally this creature tennds to peacefully stroll across the Colorado plains for several months before settling in to once again sleep. However, the "awakening period" as of this most recent update has exceeded 23 months and shows no signs of stopping. We hope to mitigate any structural damage and avoid any and all casualties, thus residents have been asked to evacuate until further eldritch methods may be invoked to send this little guy home.   </p>
